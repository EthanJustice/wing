# wing

(ec)static site generator

[Documentation](./docs/content/index.md)

**Note**: `wing` is very early in development. It has few tests, and no CI to test cross-platform. This will be improved in the future.

**Note**: `wing` was primarily built for learning purposes. It works as a static site generator, but there are more feature-rich SSGs available.

## Performance

See the latest benchmarks in the [results.txt](./bench/results.txt) file.

Benchmarks were computed on a lower-end laptop.

Benchmark built a site with 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 source files (that used the same text; each file was 1.54 KB).

The latest results:

```text
Finished (10): 109ms (.1s)

Finished (100): 486ms (.4s)

Finished (1000): 7399ms (7.3s)

Finished (10000): 201071ms (201s)
```

## Install

For now, as Wing is not on [`crates.io`](https://crates.io/) and CI hasn't been set up, installation has to be done through Cargo.

Since `wing` and `wng` are already taken on `crates.io`, the package's name is `wsg`, for **w**ing **s**ite **g**enerator.

+ latest published version on `crates.io`: `cargo install wsg`
