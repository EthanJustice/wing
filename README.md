# wing

(ec)static site generator

[Documentation](./docs/content/index.md)

**Note**: `wing` is very early in development. It has few tests, and no CI to test cross-platform. This will be improved in the future.

**Note**: `wing` was primarily built for learning purposes. It works as a static site generator, but there are more feature-rich SSGs available.

Todo:

+ tests
+ docs
+ refactor

## Install

For now, as Wing is not on [`crates.io`](https://crates.io/) and CI hasn't been set up, installation has to be done through Cargo.

Since `wing` and `wng` are already taken on `crates.io`, the package's name is `wsg`, for **w**ing **s**ite **g**enerator.

+ latest commit in the Git repository: `cargo install --git https://github.com/EthanJustice/wing.git`
+ latest published version on `crates.io`: `cargo install wsg`
