## Install

For now, as Wing is not on [`crates.io`](https://crates.io/) and CI hasn't been set up, installation has to be done through Cargo.

`cargo install --git https://github.com/EthanJustice/wing.git`

For now, `wing` doesn't support custom templates.  You can only use `index.hbs` for generation.

### Custom Metadata

For now, `wing` doesn't support custom metadata, although it provides a small amount that can be used in templates.  `custom` contains the MarkDown of the current file in HTML; `items` contains the index of files.
